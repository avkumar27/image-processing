This project implements the following methods and compares their working
1. FAST for detecting key points and FREAK as descriptor
2. FAST for detecting key points and LUCID as descriptor
3. FAST for detecting key points and optical flow(Lucas-Kane) as descriptor
These methods are used for motion estimation of vehicles.

Compiling and running instructions:
1.Open the code in eclipse aide 
2.create configurable target for the project( right click on the project and select build targets then create. Then type the target name as project name and select OK.)
3.click on the build targets and double click on the target with project name to build it.
4.open terminal from the release folder of the project.
5. Type ./project_name to execute it.

Results:
time for fast + freak : 4.78
time for fast + lucid : 4.66
time optical flow    : 5.52
